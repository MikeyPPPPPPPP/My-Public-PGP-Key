# This is my public PGP key.
I have an offline backup of the private key. This key is not stored at my house and is kept in multiple locations for redundancy. Someone I know trying to sell me rugs is ridiculous. Not even the US government can pretend to be me.
If you want security, start here


## Asset Management
On paper, write down all the things you own and categorize them based on how valuable they are to you. Then remake the list, prioritizing the items that are most important to your security.

## Figure out what is the most critical to your personal security based on the CIA and AAA triads:

CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
AAA: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting
## Threat Modeling
Think of all the adversarial threats you can imagine.
Consider threats for EVERY item you listed as most valuable in the Asset Management phase, including theoretical threats.

Think of ways to counter or prevent these threats. Remember, they can also involve people or groups of people.
Conclusion

After doing this once, youâ€™ll feel more secure. For example, I use a PO box for my home address instead of my actual house address.

By applying these industry standards to my personal life, I feel much more secure compared to the average person. If a database gets hacked, all they have is my PO box.
